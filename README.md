# CODSOFT Data Science Internship Projects  

This repository contains the projects I completed during my Data Science internship at **CODSOFT**. The focus was on solving real-world problems using machine learning techniques and data analysis. Below are the details of the three key projects included in this repository.  

## üìù Projects Overview  

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection  
- **Objective**: To build a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  - Data preprocessing and handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE.  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the dataset.  
  - Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
  - Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Outcome**: Successfully created a model that identifies fraudulent transactions with precision.  

### 2. Sales Prediction  
- **Objective**: To predict future sales based on historical data to help businesses make data-driven decisions.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  - Data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis.  
  - Time-series analysis and trend identification.  
  - Model training using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.  
  - Visualization of results for better insights into sales patterns.  
- **Outcome**: Developed a predictive model that forecasts sales trends effectively.  

### 3. Movie Rating Prediction  
- **Objective**: To create a system that predicts movie ratings based on user reviews and historical data.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  - Text preprocessing, including tokenization and sentiment analysis of user reviews.  
  - Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF and Word2Vec.  
  - Model training using algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks.  
  - Evaluation using RMSE and R-squared metrics.  
- **Outcome**: Built a recommendation-ready model for predicting movie ratings.
